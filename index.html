            <p>

                'Book Network' creates a virtual library amongst the students of a particular school. The student doesn’t need to buy novels/books. This app creates a book network amongst all the students of a given school. For example, if a school has 3,000 students
                and each student has on an average 10 novels, it creates a network of 30,000 books.

            </p>
            <p>
                Students have to sign-in on the app and mention their name, class and the details about the book (Author, Genre), which they are ready to exchange. Students can post a picture of their book so that other users can view the condition of the book. By doing
                this they get access to a huge network of books at zero cost.

            </p>
            <p>
                This app is developed on Visual Studio Code. It is coded in HTML,CSS and Javascript.
            </p>
            <p>
                If this app is used, then schools don’t need to make a heavy expenditure to build a school library.

                    <p>What makes a strong Password?</p>
                    <p>
                        A strong password consists of at least six characters (the more the characters, the stronger the password). A strong password should be a combination of characters such as commas, percent signs, parentheses, upper-case letters, lower-case letters and
                        numbers. Don't use commonly used passwords such as '123456' or '111111'.

                        Book Network is built on Visual Studio Code. It is programmed on Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheet(CSS) and JavaScript (JS).

                        We use Firebase for storing database. Firebase provides developers with a variety of tools and services to help them develop quality apps, grow their user base, and earn profit. It is built on Google's infrastructure.

                        You can simply sign-in on the app and mention your name, class and the details about the book which you are ready to exchange. You can post the picture of your book so that other users can view the condition of the book. By doing this you get access to
                        a huge network of books at zero cost. Now choose your favourite book. You can leave a message or call the owner of the book on their mobile. If both of you are willing to exchange, then during recess, you can exchange your book.
                        Viola! And this is how you share the joy of reading with your schoolmates... Happy Reading!!
